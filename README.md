This repository is based on the work of luckypamula for the [Azure AI Agents Labs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-ai-agents-labs) refactored to be used with the Python libraries announced during BUILD 2025.

Please note that version of azure-ai-projects 1.0.0b11 introduced breaking changes using Hub based Foundry projects. This repository assumes that hub-less projects are used. More information about project types can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry#which-type-of-project-do-i-need)
